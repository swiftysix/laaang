MomentRec is an audio recorder. However, the difference to a normal recorder is, that MomentRec enables you to record things which happen spontaneously and are unplanned. It can do this by constantly listening and keeping the last 30s of sound in memory. Once you press the 'record' button, it will add those 30s of audio that happened *before* you pressed the recording (kind of like an audio-based time machine).

Possible applications are to record: the first word / laughter of a baby, unkown words in a foreign language when watching  a movie, animal voices, fun on parties or your buddy's fart :D, etc.
