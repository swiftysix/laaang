Moment-rec is a portable device about the size of your palm. It's purpose is to help you learn native speakerâ€™s slang, jokes and feel at home in a foreign culture.

## General

### The problem

Moment-rec is meant to be used by people who are exposed to the culture and it's people for a longer time period (or forever) e.g. language study, expats, married foreigner, etc. The problem these people have is that they are exposed to the culture and language daily, but they can't make much sense of it, because their skills aren't high enough yet. When you life longer in a different culture you notice that there are repeating patterns of what you don't understand. However, it's really hard to capture those moments, because a phrase or joke is gone very quickly and the conversation moves on.

### Moment-rec

Moment-rec's goal is to act as an analytical tool, so you can capture various phrases, jokes and reactions of native speakers in a conversation. Later, you can study based on the captured content and ask your teacher or friends to explain it to you.

### The concept

Moment-rec is supposed to act like an acoustic time machine. As soon as you hear something of interest, you can press the button and everything from 60s in the past until present should be captured as a recording.

This will enable people to capture all kinds of phrases as soon as they heard it.
