For this project the goal was to modernize a sheet-irion shears machine with a measurement system based on step motors.

- Change feed back and forth by controlling two stepper motors
- Measure the distance to a calibrated zero point for accurate cutting
- Display to show the distance
- Controls to move the feeder
- Calibration mode to re-calibrate the machine to mechanical zero
